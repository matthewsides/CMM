# CMM (Capability Maturity Model)

The Capability Maturity Model (CMM) is a methodology or framework used to develop and refine an organization's software development process (essentially an indicator as to an organisations maturity, for this instance in particular it would be used as a bench mark for measuring an organiisations software development process)(the CMM describes the key elements of an effective software, then used to compare against a scale of five process maturity levels based on certain Key Process Areas (KPA) or as a set standard for organisations).

The model describes a five-level evolutionary path of increasingly organized and systematic processes. 

## Five Levels of CMM

1.Initial

2.Repeatable

3.Defined

4.Managed

5.Optimizing


## Two Approaches to improving software quality

### Repeatable

Through applying the Capability Maturity Model (CMM) in relation to improving the quality of software, one approach consists of the methodology that Software development successes are repeatable,though processes may not repeat for all projects in the organisation taking this approach or using the CMM second level. The organization may use some basic project management to track cost and schedule(used as framework for multiple developments, improves efficency,time, resources and money that may be allocated elsewhere i.e improving the software quality). 

Furthermore process discipline helps ensure that existing practices are retained during times of stress. When these practices are in place, projects are performed and managed according to their documented plans thus ensuring the quality of a software program as mistakes are less likely to occur or veer off from the preplanned structure.

Moreover Project status and the delivery of services are visible to management at defined points (for example, at major milestones and at the completion of major tasks), critical in ensuring the software is up  to the standard set (software quality).

Basic project management processes are established to track cost, schedule, and functionality. The minimum process discipline is in place to repeat earlier successes on projects with similar applications and scope, thus ensuring a set quality, whilst slightly imrpoving the quality over time (or each project).Though there is still a significant risk of exceeding cost and time estimate.
